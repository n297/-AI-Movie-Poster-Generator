ðŸŽ¬ AI Movie Poster Generator
This project generates AI-designed movie posters using textual descriptions (e.g., title, actors, director, synopsis).
It is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how machine learning and generative AI can create visually compelling movie posters.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
For this demo, used a small synthetic dataset of 10 movies.
Each entry includes:

Movie Title

Main Actors

Director

Genre

Synopsis


ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python 3.10+

PyTorch (for deep learning)

Diffusers (Hugging Face Stable Diffusion)

TorchVision (image transforms)

Pillow (image processing)

Hugging Face Transformers (for text encoding)


ðŸš€ How It Works

Reads movie metadata from the dataset.

Converts text (actors, plot, genre) into a descriptive prompt.

Uses Stable Diffusion to generate a high-resolution poster (up to 4K).

Optionally adds text overlays (title, credits).


âš  Limitations

Faces and fine details may not be perfect due to AI model limitations.

Small dataset means the model is not fully fine-tuned.

Text on posters may have spelling inconsistencies.
